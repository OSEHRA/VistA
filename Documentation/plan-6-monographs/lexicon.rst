It has been a while since the last full blog post on the Plan VI project. This 
post will be the first in a series focusing on the changes needed in the VistA
M side code in order for VistA to be usable outside of the US.

This post focuses on modifying the VistA Lexicon to contain the Korean ICD-10
system in order for VistA to be usable in Korea for clinical purposes. We end
up looking at two different ways in which we can do that.
